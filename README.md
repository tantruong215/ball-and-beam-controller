# Ball-and-Beam Control System

A classical control demo system using a servo-controlled beam to balance a steel ball based on position feedback from IR sensors.

---

### ⚙️ Hardware Design
- 1x Servo motor (beam rotation)
- IR distance sensor (ball position)
- Arduino UNO microcontroller

---

### 🧠 Control/Software Features
- PID controller with tunable Kp/Ki/Kd
- Live position display on LCD
- Sweep test to characterize plant gain

---

### 📊 Results (Expected)
- ±1 cm position error on 20 cm beam
- Rise time < 1s, settling < 3s
- Demonstrate system stability across load masses

---

### 🧰 Tools Used
- Arduino IDE, C++
- Excel (data logging)
- Python (control tuning)

---

### 🚧 Project Status
🛠️ Status: In Progress – Summer 2025
